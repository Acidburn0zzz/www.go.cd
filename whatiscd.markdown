title: Why Continuous Delivery?

###Fail fast to learn fast

With Continuous Delivery, teams ensure that every change to the system is releasable, and that we can release any version at the push of a button. Every change to the system is tested all the way through to a production like environment, making releases worry-free.

Many software teams have been practicing <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html" target="_blank">Continuous Integration</a> (CI) for some time now. CI helps make sure software is tested, but it doesn’t get it to users. Continuous Delivery (CD) can be considered a natural extension of CI. Instead of taking a “build” that the development team is familiar with and throwing it over the wall to QA or IT operations people that have never seen it, CD gives you the ability to make all of the groups part of the process.

The key to CD is the concept of a pipeline. With this concept, every check in to source code results in a release candidate. The further that build is able to progress through the automated verification which constitutes the pipeline, the more like that version is to be released to users.

The process allows you to make changes to your software, assess the change at the micro level, and then react as a business.

A properly implemented pipeline makes the path from code commit to production easy to understand.
