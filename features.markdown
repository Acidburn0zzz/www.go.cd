			<h3 class="features__title">Workflow modeling</h3>
			<p>Go's tasks, stages, and pipelines are the building blocks with which you model your deployment pipeline. Fast feedback, self-service, and 1-click deployments are easily modeled. Parallel and sequential execution works exactly as you would expect. <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/model-everything-fail-fast">Here's a glimpse</a> at what's possible to model in Go.</p>

			<h3 class="features__title">Artifact Promotion</h3>
			<p>Any particular pipeline instance is anchored to a particular changeset. And Go makes it easy to pass once-built binaries between stages. With Go, you know exactly what's being deployed and that the binary has been tested.</p>

			<h3 class="features__title">Value Stream Map</h3>
			<p>It sounds cliche, but Go's real power is in the visibility it provides over your end-to-end workflow. The Value Stream Map allows you to follow a change from commit to deploy with a glance. And when things go wrong, it is easy to see both the upstream cause and the downstream effects.</p>

			<h3 class="features__title">Self-Service</h3>
			<p>Continuous Delivery empowers a QA team. With code always ready to deploy, testers can manage their own environments, deploying whatever version they like, whenever they like. Go's manual triggers enable this. And, if necessary, it's securable and auditable.</p>

			<h3 class="features__title">Test Execution and Reporting</h3>
			<p>Verification is a key piece of any deployment pipeline. Go will execute tests written in most any language or framework. Go's agent grid provides parallel and cross-platform execution. Go's test reporting will tell you in exactly which changeset and on which platform a test started breaking, which comes in extremely handy when fixing a fantastically broken build.</p>

			<h3 class="features__title">Compare Builds</h3>
			<p>Go's compare feature can provide a simple bill of materials for any deployment. Perhaps more powerful is it's ability to compare the contents, both files and commit messages, across any two arbitrary builds. This is invaluable when troubleshooting a broken pipeline.</p>

			<h3 class="features__title">Fan-in/Fan-out Pipeline Dependency Management</h3>
			<p>One of the trickier aspects of dependency management in Go is when a pipeline has multiple upstream dependencies or has multiple downstream dependents. With it's fan-in/fan-out dependency management, Go always tries to do the "right thing," avoiding spurious builds and unverified configurations. Fan-in/fan-out is non-trivial and you should read more about it <a href="http://support.thoughtworks.com/entries/22229668-Go-s-Dependency-Management">here</a></p>

			<h3 class="features__title">Agent Grid</h3>
			<p>Go's agents run remotely and in a grid. This eliminates bottlenecks, providing trivial parallel execution across platforms, versions, branches, etc.</p>

			<p>Easily re-use pipeline layouts via Go's configuration templates. This makes managing pipelines for versions and branches easy.</p>

			<h3 class="features__title">Just Enough Permissions</h3>
			<p>While most enterprise applications go overboard with their permission model, Go seeks to provide just enough. In particular, Go supports auditable stage triggering, i.e., deployment, and can delegate the configuration of pipelines to users without full-blown admin privileges.</p>
