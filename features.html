			<h3 class="features__title"> <i class='number'>1</i> Model complex workflows</h3>
			<p>Go's <span class="feature_word">pipelines</span> are the building blocks with which you model your deployment pipeline. With Go, you can easily configure dependencies for fast feedback and on-demand deployment. Parallel and sequential execution work exactly as you would expect. <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/model-everything-fail-fast">Here's a glimpse</a> at what's possible to model in Go.</p>
			<p>With it's <span class="feature_word">fan-in/fan-out dependency management</span>, Go always tries to do the "right thing," avoiding spurious builds and unverified configurations. Fan-in/fan-out is non-trivial and you should read more about it <a href="http://support.thoughtworks.com/entries/22229668-Go-s-Dependency-Management">here</a></p>

			<h3 class="features__title"><i class='number'>2</i>Promote trusted artifacts</h3>
			<p>Any particular pipeline instance is anchored to a particular changeset. And Go makes it easy to <span class="feature_word">pass once-built binaries</span> between stages. You know exactly what's being deployed and that the binary has been tested.</p>

			<h3 class="features__title"><i class='number'>3</i>See how things <i>really</i> work</h3>
			<p>It sounds cliche, but Go's real power is in the visibility it provides over your end-to-end workflow. The <span class="feature_word">Value Stream Map</span> allows you to follow a change from commit to deploy with a glance. And when things go wrong, it is easy to see both the upstream cause and the downstream effects.</p>

			<h3 class="features__title"><i class='number'>4</i>Deploy any version, any time</h3>
			<p>Go's <span class="feature_word">manual triggers</span> allow you to deploy any known good version of your application to wherever you like. Beyond reliable pushes to production, this empowers QA teams with self-service environments. And, if necessary, it's securable and auditable.</p>

			<h3 class="features__title"><i class='number'>5</i>Run and grok your tests</h3>
			<p>Verification is a key piece of any deployment pipeline. Go will <span class="feature_word">execute tests</span> written in most any language or framework. Go's agent grid provides parallel and cross-platform execution. Go's <span class="feature_word">test reporting</span> will tell you in exactly which changeset and on which platform a test started breaking, which comes in extremely handy when fixing a fantastically broken build.</p>

			<h3 class="features__title"><i class='number'>6</i>Compare builds</h3>
			<p>Go's <span class="feature_word">compare builds</span> feature can provide a simple bill of materials for any deployment. Perhaps more powerful is it's ability to compare the contents, both files and commit messages, across any two arbitrary builds. This is invaluable when troubleshooting a broken pipeline.</p>

			<h3 class="features__title"><i class='number'>7</i>Eliminate bottlenecks</h3>
			<p>Go's <span class="feature_word">agent grid</span> eliminates bottlenecks, providing trivial parallel execution across pipelines, platforms, versions, branches, etc.</p>

			<h3 class="features__title"><i class='number'>8</i>Keep configuration tidy</h3>
			<p>Easily re-use pipeline configurations via Go's <span class="feature_word">template system</span>. This makes managing pipelines for versions and branches easy as pie.</p>

			<h3 class="features__title"><i class='number'>9</i>Trust your team; be responsible</h3>
			<p>While most enterprise applications go overboard with their permission model, Go seeks to provide just enough. In particular, Go supports <span class="feature_word">auditable deployment</span> and Go can <span class="feature_word">delegate the configuration of pipelines</span> to users without full-blown admin privileges.</p>
