Go is going open source!

Go is a continuous delivery (CD) solution from my employer, ThoughtWorks. Go is truly a CD system, not a CI server with added widgets to emulate a CD system. That means features like pipelines are first order concepts, letting you easily map your entire build / test / release pipeline in one place.

I'm personally really excited about this, as I probably owe my career to open source. If it wasn't for the Linux, FreeBSD, NCSA, Apache and PHP, I never would have gotten started.

I've been working on the new program the last few weeks a lot of people have asked me why we're doing it with Go. The simple answer, it's the right thing to do.

Increasingly we hear from the industry that platform infrastructure. The are many reasons of course, everything from knowing exactly what's going on to being able to make their own tweaks especially for their environment. While Go doesn't "run" in production, it manages the things that do run there. I'll be talking a lot more about this in the coming weeks.

ThoughtWorks also wants to really light the CD practice industry on fire. A lot of people are talking about CD, but very few are really doing it. We believe removing one more barrier to true CD can only help the industry.

We're public announcing the change today, and the source code itself will be available as soon as possible.
