On 25 Feb 2014 ThoughtWorks announced that Go is now available under the Apache 2.0 open source license. We're really excited for the next chapter!

Quite a few people have asked what drove the decision to make Go open source. The bottom line is that it's the right thing to do for today's market. 

Several years ago, before ThoughtWorks had a product division, we created something called CruiseControl for continuous integration. We believe that 
product had a lot to do with the adoption of CI practices, and want to enable the same kind of change for continuous delivery. We've also heard loud
and clear that many organizations want more control over anything that's working with their production systems. Opening up Go will give those people
that want it that additional control. 

The other set of questions we've gotten a lot are about how the project will be run. The existing Go team will still be developing Go, ThoughtWorks 
will still provide professional support, but we'll also encourage anyone to participate.
