On 25 Feb 2014 ThoughtWorks announced that Go is now available under the Apache 2.0 open source license. We're really excited for the next chapter!

We've had quite a few questions about the change. Here are a few of them...

###Why the change?

* **It's the right thing to do for today's market**

  * **Organizations expect it.** We've observed a real move to organizations’ insisting that the components that make up their production platform be almost exclusively OSS. While Go doesn’t “run” in production, it does manage what is and isn’t in prod, and it’s therefore “platform” infrastructure. (This is driven by many things: ability to contribute, ability to see the source and know how stuff works, significantly lower likelihood of security holes, etc.)
  * **Practitioners expect it.** In selling commercial Go we often have prospects tell us that they prefer open source software. The objection is rarely about price, rather the feeling that it’s the right thing to do and the ability to make changes that are important to their usage. Many existing customers have asked to be able to make their own changes.
  * **Grow the practice of continuous delivery.** Several years ago, before ThoughtWorks had a product division, we created something called CruiseControl for continuous integration. We believe that product had a lot to do with the adoption of CI practices, and want to enable the same kind of change for continuous delivery.

###Is ThoughtWorks still working on Go?

* **Yes!** The current Go development team at [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com) is definitely still working to enhance the product as well as help others who may wish to particpate in the new open source program.
* **ThoughtWorks still provides professional help** There's still a 20+ year old global company providing support to organizations who desire a commercial channel. You can learn more about their offerings on [ThoughtWorks' website](http://www.thoughtworks.com/products/go-continuous-delivery/).

###How will the project be run?

* **As a "proper" open source project.** Anyone who wishes to participate in the future of Go is encouraged to do so.

  * **Push Access** If a person makes quality contributions on a regular basis they may be nominated by the current committers to be granted push access to the GitHub repositories. When someone is nominated, the current committers will vote. The process will be the same for everyone.
  * **Types of participation.** All participation is encouraged. This could mean helping out on the mailing lists, making documentation updates, fixing bugs or any of the other things involved in creating a solid software product.
